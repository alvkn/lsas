LightSteamAccountSwitcher is a lightweight, native Windows application built with .NET and WPF (MVVM) for fast switching between Steam accounts.

## Project Goal
This project is a "Lite" hard fork of the [TcNo Account Switcher](https://github.com/TCNOco/TcNo-Acc-Switcher). The primary objective is to provide a clean, high-performance alternative by stripping away all non-native dependencies, including ASP.NET, Blazor, and external web servers, focusing exclusively on Steam account management.

## Features
- Fast Steam account switching.
- Native Windows UI (WPF).
- No web-tech bloat.
- Portable and lightweight.
